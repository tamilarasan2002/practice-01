		<p
			To understand <b>"HTML" </b>from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:<br>
			tamilarasan
			<b>Hypertext:</b> <br>
			text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items<br>

			<b>Markup:</b><br> 
			a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format<br>

			<b>Language:</b><br>
			a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.<br>
			HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive.<br>
			So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.<br>
			In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.<br>
			HTML is the skeleton,<br>
			CSS is the skin,<br>
			and JavaScript <br></p>
